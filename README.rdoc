Sound Locale is a work-in-progress, the end-goal being a responsive app that displays local event information on a google map and list, fully filterable and sortable.

Plans are to eventually include social media sharing.

Currently implementing event data from Ticketfly and Stubhub.

Currently using Ruby 2.1.1 and Rails 4.1.4
