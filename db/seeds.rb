The theater was renamed in 1922 and became an important part of the community. The theater was also initially a movie house and went through various phases over the years. In 1994, Chris Swank and a business partner invested in the Bluebird and it re-opened as a mecca for music that you know today. The theater is laid out in tiers with a balcony overlooking the entire space."

Cervantes’ Masterpiece Ballroom separates itself from other Denver live music venues for a multitude of reasons, but the dual venue feature makes Cervantes’ stand out the most. Cervantes’ holds 900 people and includes a balcony that wraps around the entire room creating a very intimate setting. Cervantes’ incorporates a top of the line sound system, including a Meyer MICALine Array with four boxes per side and six Meyer 650P subs. This arrangement translates into full sound that can be heard throughout the venue from front to back. The Other Side holds 500 people and has equally impressive traits."
